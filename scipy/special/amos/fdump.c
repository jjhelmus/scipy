/*        ***Note*** Machine Dependent Routine */
/*        FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written */
/*        version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this, */
/*        it should be replaced by a version which prints the */
/*        subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be */
/*        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the */
/*        XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details. */
